                <p>The accordion component in Bootstrap is a UI element that organizes content into expandable and
                    collapsible panels. It is useful for managing large amounts of content or limited screen space.
                    Accordions consist of a container with multiple items, each with a header and a content area.
                    Headers act as triggers for expanding or collapsing content areas, enabling users to focus on one
                    section at a time.</p>

            <!-- Flush Accordion -->

                    <h5>Flush</h5>
                    <p>The flush accordion has no borders or rounded corners around its panels and can be used to create
                        a seamless look between adjacent panels.
